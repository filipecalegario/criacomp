In the video on OpenAI Whisper, I mentioned how words whose vectors are numerically similar are also similar in semantic meaning. In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement semantic search using OpenAI embeddings. Understanding the Embeddings concept will be crucial to the next several videos in this series since we will use it to build several practical applications.\n",
