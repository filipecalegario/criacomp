### MCP Deep Investigation

* [Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)
  * an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools.
  * developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.
* [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol): Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools.
* [Introduction - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)
  * Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications.
  * MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs.
